## 8 Essential Plugins for Visual Studio Code 

#### 1 - Quokka
Quokka is a debugging tool that gives live feedback on the code you are writing. It shows you previews of the results of functions and calculated values for variables. The extension is easy to configure and works out of the box with JSX or TypeScript projects.
#### 2 - HTML Boilerplate
The HTML boilerplate extension will save you from having to manually write the head and body tags of a new HTML document. Just type html in an empty file, hit the Tab key, and a clean document structure will be generated. 
#### 3 - Prettier
Prettier is the most popular code formatter in web dev right now. It allows your team's code look the same, no matter who wrote it. This extension makes it possible to automatically apply Prettier and quickly format whole JS and CSS documents. If you also want to throw ESLint in the mix, there is Prettier - Eslint.
#### 4 - Minify
Extension for minifying your code. It offers a ton of customization settings and the option to automatically minify on save and export to a .min file. Minify works with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML through uglify-js, clean-css, and html-minifier respectively.

# Top JavaScript VSCode Extensions for Faster Development 

VSCode is an open-source, cross-platform editor that has become a favourite of programmers, particularly in the Web Development community. It’s fast, extensible, customisable, and has tons of features. You should check it out if you haven’t already done it.
Thousands of extensions have been made for VSCode. I am going to list a few extensions that I use on a day-to-day basis. Let’s begin!

 #### 1 - Quokka.js
Quokka.js is a rapid prototyping playground for JavaScript and TypeScript. What that means is that it runs your code immediately as you type and displays various execution results in your code editor. Try it yourself.

 #### 2 - Bracket Pair Colorizer and Indent Rainbow 
Brackets and parentheses are an inseparable part many programming languages. In a language such as JavaScript, a single page can have a barrage these characters with no easy mechanism to identify opening and closing pairs. Welcome Bracket Pair Colorizer and Indent Rainbow. These are two different extensions. However, they really make a good and beautiful couple. These extensions will fill your editor with a flurry of colours, and make the code blocks easily discernible and pleasing to the eyes. Once you get used to them, VSCode feels insipid, and bland without them.

 #### 3 - Snippets
Snippets are shorthands in an editor. So instead of writing import React from 'react';, you can type imr and press Tab to expand this snippet. Similarly, clg becomes console.log.
There exists a lot of snippets for all sorts of things: Javascript(or any other language), React, Redux, Angular, Vue, Jest. I personally find Javascript snippets really useful since I work mostly with JS.
Some good snippet extensions are —
•	JavaScript (ES6) code snippets
•	React-Native/React/Redux snippets for es6/es7
•	React Standard Style code snippets

 #### 4 - REST Client
As a web developer, we often need to work with REST APIs. For examining the URLs and checking the responses, tools like Postman are used. But why have a different app when your editor can easily do the same task. Welcome REST Client. It allows you to send HTTP request and view the response in Visual Studio Code directly.

 #### 5 - Auto Close Tag and Auto Rename Tag
Since the advent of React and the traction it has gained in the last few years, HTML-like syntax in the form of JSX is all the rage now. We again have to code with tags JavaScript. Any web developer you would tell you that it is a pain to type the tags. In most cases, we need a tool that can quickly and easily generate tags and their children. Emmet is a really good example of this already built into VSCode. However, sometimes, you do just want something simple and concise. Such as an auto tag closer, which generates the closing pair of a tag as you type the opening pair. And when you change that same tag, the closing tag automatically gets changed. These two extensions do just that.
